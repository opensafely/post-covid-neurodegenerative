## Repository navigation

-   Detailed protocols are in the [`protocol`](./protocol/) folder:

    - [`post-covid-events-neurodegenerative`](protocol/post-covid-events-neurodegenerative.pdf) contains the outcome-specific elements necessary to implement [`post-covid-events-ehrql`](protocol/post-covid-events-ehrql.pdf)

-   If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look at [`codelists/codelists.txt`](./codelists/codelists.txt) for the full list, or any of the *.csv files in the [`codelists`](./codelists) folder

-   The following scripts are in the [`analysis`](./analysis) directory:

    -   [`utility.R`](./analysis/utility.R) contains some generic functions which are used throughout the pipeline e.g. a rounding function, a display function, a type conversion function
    -   [`study_dates.R`](./analysis/study_dates.R) creates [`output/study_dates.json`](./output/study_dates.json) which stores the date-specific metadata (e.g. the start dates of the phases of the study, vaccine dates)

    -   Dataset definition scripts are in the [`dataset_definition`](./analysis/dataset_definition/) directory:
        -   [`variable_helper_functions.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/variable_helper_functions.py) defines ehrQL functions that generate variables
        -   [`codelists.py`](./analysis/dataset_definition/codelists.py) creates codelist variables that can be accessed by [`variables_cohorts.R`](./analysis/variables_cohorts.py)
        -   [`variables_cohorts.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/variables_cohorts.py) uses the helper functions to create a dictionary of variables for cohort definitions
        -   [`variables_dates.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/variables_dates.py) creates a dictionary of variables for calculating study start dates and end dates
        -   [`dataset_definition_dates.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_dates.py) generates a dataset with all required dates for each cohort (e.g., index and end dates), which are further described in the protocol. This script imports all variables generated from [`variables_dates`](./analysis/dataset_definition/variables_dates.py).
        -   [`dataset_definition_cohorts.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_cohorts.py) defines a function that generates cohorts. This script imports all variables generated from [`variables_cohorts.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/variables_cohorts.py) using the patient's index date, the cohort start date and the cohort end date. 
        -   [`dataset_definition_prevax.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_prevax.py), [`dataset_definition_vax.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_vax.py), and [`dataset_definition_unvax.R`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_unvax.py) use [`dataset_definition_cohorts`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition_cohorts.py) to generate the pre-vaccination, vaccinated, and unvaccinated cohorts respectively 

    -   Dataset cleaning scripts are in the [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) directory:
        -   This directory also contains all the R scripts that process, describe, and analyse the extracted data.
        -   [`dataset_clean.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/dataset_clean.R) is the core script which executes all the other scripts in this folder
        -   [`fn-preprocess.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-preprocess.R) is the function carrying out initial preprocessing, formatting columns correctly
        -   [`fn-modify_dummy.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-modify_dummy.R) is called from within fn-preprocess.R, and alters the proportions of dummy variables to better suit analyses
        -   [`fn-inex.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-inex.R) is the inclusion/exclusion function
        -   [`fn-qa.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-qa.R) is the quality assurance function
        -   [`fn-ref.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-ref.R) is the function that sets the reference levels for factors 
    
    -   Table 1 scripts are in the [`table1`](./analysis/table1/) directory:
        -   This directory contains a single script:  [`table1.R`](./analysis/table1/table1.R). This script works with the output of [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) to describe the patient characteristics, displaying the proportion of study population in each variable category

    -   Modelling scripts are in the [`model`](./analysis/model/) directory:
        -   [`make_model_input.R`](./analysis/model/make_model_input.R) works with the output of [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) to prepare suitable data subsets for Cox analysis. Combines each outcome and subgroup in one formatted .rds file
        -   [`fn-prepare_model_input.R`](./analysis/model/fn-prepare_model_input.R) is a companion function to [`make_model_input.R`](./analysis/model/make_model_input.R) which handles the interaction with [`active_analyses.rds`](lib/active_analyses.rds)
        -   [`fn-check_vitals.R`](./analysis/model/fn-check_vitals.R) is a companion function that checks the input dataset for [`make_model_input.R`](./analysis/model/make_model_input.R) is formatted correctly
        -   [`cox-ipw`](https://github.com/opensafely-actions/cox-ipw/) is a reusable action which uses the output of [`make_model_input.R`](./analysis/model/make_model_input.R) to fit a Cox model to the data. (NB: It is not a file in the server)
        -   [`cox_model.do`](./analysis/model/cox_model.do) is a Stata script used to rerun Cox models in Stata when they fail to converge in R (i.e.,  [`cox-ipw`](https://github.com/opensafely-actions/cox-ipw/)), specified by the user in [`create_project_actions.R`](./analysis/create_project_actions.R)

    -   Extra files that suppport the Cox regression command in Stata for [`cox_model.do`](./analysis/model/cox_model.do) are in the [`extra_ados`](./analysis/extra_ados/) directory
    
    -   Table 2 scripts are in the [`table2`](./analysis/table2/) directory:
        -   This directory contains a single script:  [`table2.R`](./analysis/table2/table2.R). This script works with the output of [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) to calculate pre- and post-exposure event counts and person days of follow-up for all outcomes and subgroups
    
    -   Venn scripts are in the [`venn`](./analysis/venn/) directory:
        -   This directory contains a single script:  [`venn.R`](./analysis/venn/venn.R). This script works with the output of [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) to create venn diagram data for all outcomes reporting where outcomes are sourced from i.e. primary care, secondary care or deaths data

    -   Output scripts are in the [`make_output`](./analysis/make_output/) directory:
        -   [`make_model_output.R`](./analysis/make_output/make_model_output.R) combines all the Cox results in one formatted .csv file per subgroup
        -   [`make_other_output.R`](./analysis/model/make_other_output.R) combines cohort-specific outputs (e.g. the table1 outputs) into 1 .csv file
        -   [`make_aer_input.R`](./analysis/make_output/make_aer_input.R) generates summary statistics by age and sex required for AER (Absolute Excess Risk) estimation for each outcome (using the model input files for the main analysis generated from [`make_model_input`](analysis/model/make_model_input.R))

    - Post release scripts for tidying up the outputs are in the ['post_release'](./analysis/post_release/) directory. They are not run on through the project.yaml file on OpenSAFELY, but run locally in order to prepare tables and figures for publication.

    These scripts are in the [`analysis`](./analysis) directory, but are not accessed when the repository is run on a job server
        
    -   [`create_project_actions.R`](./analysis/create_project_actions.R) is the function which creates the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml), the list of actions which can be run in OpenSAFELY (NB: this is not accessed during the core pipeline run)

    -   Active analyses scripts are in the [`active_analyses`](./analysis/active_analyses/) directory (NB: these are not accessed during the core pipeline run):
        -   [`active_analyses.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/active_analyses.R) creates [`lib/active_analyses`](./lib/active_analyses.rds), the list of analyses to be run
        -   [`fn-add_analysis.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/fn-add_analysis.R) a companion function to [`active_analyses.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/active_analyses.R) to cleanly add new rows to the analyses file

        
-   Other useful files include the following:        

    -   The [`lib/active_analyses.rds`](lib/active_analyses.rds) contains a list of active analyses. To edit this file, alter either [`active_analyses.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/active_analyses.R) or [`fn-add_analysis.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/fn-add_analysis.R)

    -   The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) defines run-order and dependencies for all the analysis scripts. This file should not be edited directly. To make changes to the yaml, edit and run the [`create_project_actions.R`](analysis/create_project_actions.R) script which generates all the actions

-   Combined model and descriptive outputs, including figures and tables are in the [`output/make_output`](./output/make_output) directory (which will be created once the pipeline runs)

## Running the pipeline after alterations

When running, you should first check if [`active_analyses`](lib/active_analyses.rds) exists (and is up to date)

  - If not, create [`output/study_dates.json`](./output/study_dates.json) by running the `study_dates` action (e.g. with `opensafely run study_dates`)

  - Then, run [`active_analyses.R`](./analysis/active_analyses/active_analyses.R) locally to create/update [`active_analyses`](lib/active_analyses.rds)

If necessary, run [`create_project_actions.R`](./analysis/create_project_actions.R) to recreate the [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml)

Afterwards, proceed to run the scripts as normal (on the OpenSAFELY server, or locally with `opensafely run run_all -f` using dummy data)

## Outcomes
